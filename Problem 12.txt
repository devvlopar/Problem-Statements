PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Write a Python program to generate a pattern using nested loops. The program should prompt the user to enter a number, and then display a pattern as follows:

Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
1
22
333
4444
55555

Sample Input 1:
3
Sample Output 1:
1
22
333

Sample Input 2:
7
Sample Output 2:
1
22
333
4444
55555
666666
7777777

CONSTRAINTS:

Use nested loops to generate the pattern.
Ensure that the user enters a valid numeric input using a while loop.
Include appropriate variable names and follow naming conventions.
