PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Write a Python program to calculate the cost of admission to a zoo based on the age of the visitor. The admission rates are as follows:
Children (ages 0-5): Free
Kids (ages 6-12): $5
Teenagers (ages 13-17): $8
Adults (ages 18-59): $12
Seniors (ages 60 and above): $6
Your program should prompt the user to enter their age using the input() function, calculate the admission cost based on the given rates, and then print the total cost.


Sample Input 1:
25
Sample Output 1:
$12


Sample Input 2:
8
Sample Output 2:
$5


Sample Input 1:
78
Sample Output 1:
$6

CONSTRAINTS:

Utilize conditional statements (if, else, elif) to determine the admission cost.
Handle cases where the user enters non-numeric input or invalid age values.
Use appropriate variable names and follow naming conventions.
NoneType, Reference, or Falsy Values should not affect the program's functionality.
