Write a Python program that takes an integer `num` as input and prints the factorial of `num`.

Sample Input/Output:
```
Input:
num = 5
Output:
120
Explanation: The factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

Input:
num = 3
Output:
6
Explanation: The factorial of 3 is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.

Input:
num = 0
Output:
1
Explanation: The factorial of 0 is defined as 1.
```

Constraints:
- 0 <= num <= 10^3



_________________Problem 3_______________
You are tasked with creating a program that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number using a combination of for loops, while loops, and the range function.

Write a Python Program that takes an integer `num` as input and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `num`.

Sample Input/Output:
```
Input:
num = 10
Output:
1
1
2
3
5
8
Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to 10 is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].

Input:
num = 20
Output:
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to 20 is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

Input:
num = 1
Output:
1
1
Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to 1 is 1, 1.
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= num <= 10^3




_________________Problem 4_______________
You are tasked with creating a program that iterates over a list of numbers and prints each number. However, if the number is negative, the program should skip it using the `continue` statement.

Write a Python program that takes a 5 of integers as input in a list and prints each positive number in the list.

Sample Input/Output:
```
Input:
numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]
Output:
1
3
5

Input:
numbers = [-10, 0, 20, -30]
Output:
20

Input:
numbers = [-1, -2, -3, -8, -7]
Output: (No output)
```






_________________Problem 5_______________
You are tasked with creating a program that finds the longest word in a given sentence.

Write a Python Program that takes a string `sentence` as input and prints the longest word in the sentence. If there are multiple longest words, return the first one encountered.

Sample Input/Output:
```
Input:
sentence = "I love programming"
Output:
"programming"

Input:
sentence = "Python is awesome and versatile"
Output:
"versatile"

Input:
sentence = "This is a test"
Output:
"This"
```





_________________Problem 6_______________
You are assigned a task to create a program that counts the occurrences of a given character in a string.

Write a Python program that takes a string `string` and a character `char` as input and prints the number of times the character appears in the string.

Sample Input/Output:
```
Input:
string = "hello world"
char = "l"
Output:
3

Input:
string = "programming is fun"
char = "m"
Output:
2

Input:
string = "hello"
char = "z"
Output:
0
```




_________________Problem 7_______________
You are tasked with creating a program that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given sentence.

Write a Python program that takes a string `sentence` as input and prints the sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized.

Sample Input/Output:
```
Input:
sentence = "hello world"
Output:
"Hello World"

Input:
sentence = "python is fun"
Output:
"Python Is Fun"

Input:
sentence = "this is a test"
Output:
"This Is A Test"
```



_________________Problem 8_______________
You are assigned a task to create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

Write a Python Program that takes a string `string` as input and prints `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. Ignore spaces and capitalization when checking for palindromes.

```
Input:
string = "racecar"
Output:
True

Input:
string = "hello"
Output:
