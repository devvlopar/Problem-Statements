PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Write a Python program that asks the user for their age and determines their eligibility to participate in a coding competition. The eligibility criteria are as follows:
Participants must be between 12 and 18 years old (inclusive) to qualify.
Participants aged 19 or above are considered too old for the competition.
Your program should prompt the user to enter their age using the input() function, validate the age based on the given criteria, and then print a message indicating whether the participant is eligible or not.

Sample Input 1:
15
Sample Output 1:
Eligible

Sample Input 2:
19
Sample Output 2:
Not Eligible

Sample Input 3:
89
Sample Output 3:
Not Eligible


CONSTRAINTS:

Use appropriate variable names and follow naming conventions.
Utilize conditional statements (if, else, elif) to check the eligibility conditions.
Handle cases where the user enters non-numeric input or invalid age values.
NoneType, Reference, or Falsy Values should not affect the program's functionality.
