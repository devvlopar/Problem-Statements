PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Write a Python program that takes four integers as input representing the scores obtained by a student in four different subjects: English, History, Science, and Art. Calculate and display the weighted average of these scores based on the given weights:

English: 30%
History: 25%
Science: 30%
Art: 15%
The weighted average is calculated using the formula:

Weighted Average
= (English×0.30+History×0.25+Science×0.30+Art×0.15) / Total Weight

Sample Input 1:
80
70
85
60
Sample Output 1:
Weighted Average: 74.5

Sample Input 2:
90
92
88
95
Sample Output 2:
Weighted Average: 91.15

Sample Input 3:
75
80
70
68
Sample Output 3:
Weighted Average: 74.15

Constraints:
0 ≤ marks ≤ 100
The sum of weights (English + History + Science + Art) is always 100%.
